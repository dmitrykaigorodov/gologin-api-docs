# Cloud run anti-detect web browser

Cloud run scraping browser run on the servers of GoLogin, instead of your local machine. In what cases

To run browser in the cloud just add `cloud: true` to the list of params when calling `gologinApi.launch()`.

```
  const { browser } = await gologin.launch({cloud: true});
```


# Benefits of running scraping browser in the Cloud

1. **Scalability**: Quickly scale up or down the number of instances running to match your scraping needs.
2. **Resource Efficiency**: Offload the computational and network load from your local machine to cloud servers.
3. **Reduced Local Footprint**: No need to install and maintain browser software on local machines.
4. **Improved Uptime**: Cloud services typically offer high availability and reliability.
5. **Concurrency**: Run multiple scraping tasks in parallel without affecting each other's performance.
6. **Security**: Enhanced security features like sandboxing and isolated environments.
7. **Maintenance**: Automatic updates and maintenance of the browser environment.
8. **Compliance**: Helps in complying with scraping policies by rotating and managing identities.
9. **Data Storage**: Integrated cloud storage options for saving scraped data.
10. **Performance**: Leverage powerful cloud infrastructure for faster data processing and extraction.
11. **Integration**: Seamlessly integrate with other cloud services and APIs.
12. **Reliability**: Less risk of scraping interruptions due to local network issues.
13. **Cost-Effectiveness**: Pay-as-you-go pricing models can be more economical than maintaining extensive local infrastructure.

## Make your first run of browser in the cloud

<Note>
  Before you can make requests to the GoLogin API, you will need to grab your
  API key from your dashboard. You find it under [Settings &raquo; API](https://app.gologin.com/personalArea/TokenApi).
</Note>

<CodeGroup tag="cloud" label="Run anti-detect browser in the cloud">

```js
import { GologinApi } from 'gologin';

const token = process.env.GL_API_TOKEN;
const gologin = GologinApi({ token });

async function main() {
  const { browser } = await gologin.launch({cloud: true});
  const page = await browser.newPage();
  await page.goto('https://iphey.com/', { waitUntil: 'networkidle2' });
  const status = await page.$eval('.trustworthy-status:not(.hide)', 
    (elt) => elt?.innerText?.trim()
  );

  return status; // Expecting 'Trustworthy'
}

main().catch(console.error).
  then(console.info).finally(gologin.exit);
```

```python
PYTHON

```

</CodeGroup>


## Running code yourself

<CodeGroup tag="github.com" label="Run scrapping example">
```bash
git clone git@github.com:gologinapp/gologin.git
cd gologin
npm install

GL_API_TOKEN=[YOUR_GOLOGIN_API_TOKEN] node examples/example-cloud.js
```
</CodeGroup>
