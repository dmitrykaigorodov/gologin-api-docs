# Using headless browser mode for scrapping

To make scrapping browser start in headless mode just add `headless: true` to the list of params when calling the `launch()` function.


```
  const { browser } = await gologin.launch({headless: true});
```

# Benefits of running scraping browser in the Cloud

- **Cost Savings**: Lower resource usage translates to lower operational costs, especially in cloud environments where resources are billed based on usage.
- **Scalability**: Reduced resource consumption and increased speed mean that you can run more scraping instances simultaneously, enhancing scalability.
- **Resource Efficiency**: Headless browsers consume less memory and CPU since they don't have to render a user interface, leading to more efficient use of system resources.
- **Automation**: Headless mode is well-suited for automated scripts, allowing for seamless integration with CI/CD pipelines and other automated processes.
- **Less Bandwidth**: Since headless browsers don't load unnecessary UI elements, they typically use less bandwidth, which can be beneficial for large-scale scraping operations.
- **Remote Execution**: Headless browsers can be run on remote servers without needing a display, making it easier to manage and deploy scraping tasks across different environments.
- **Parallel Execution**: The lightweight nature of headless browsers allows for running multiple instances in parallel, improving the efficiency of scraping operations.
- **Continuous Monitoring**: They are ideal for continuous monitoring of websites for changes, such as price tracking, content updates, or availability checks.
- **Security**: Running headless browsers can mitigate the risk of drive-by downloads and other security threats associated with rendering untrusted web pages.
- **Non-interactive Operations**: Perfect for scenarios where no user interaction is required, such as backend data collection and processing.
- **API Simulation**: Headless browsers can simulate user interactions with APIs in web applications, allowing for comprehensive end-to-end testing.
- **Speed**: Without the overhead of rendering a UI, headless browsers can load and interact with web pages faster than their full-featured counterparts.


### Code sample using Headless browser scrapping 

<CodeGroup tag="headless" label="Run headless browser">

```js
import { GologinApi } from 'gologin';

const token = process.env.GL_API_TOKEN;
const gologin = GologinApi({ token });

async function main() {
  const { browser } = await gologin.launch({headless: true});
  const page = await browser.newPage();
  await page.goto('https://iphey.com/', { waitUntil: 'networkidle2' });
  const status = await page.$eval('.trustworthy-status:not(.hide)', 
    (elt) => elt?.innerText?.trim()
  );

  return status; // Expecting 'Trustworthy'
}

main().catch(console.error).
  then(console.info).finally(gologin.exit);
```

```python
PYTHON

```

## Clone and run headless scraping browser code sample

Start with pre-build and tested code example:

<CodeGroup tag="github.com" label="Run scrapping example">
```bash
git clone git@github.com:gologinapp/gologin.git
cd gologin
npm install

GL_API_TOKEN=[YOUR_GOLOGIN_API_TOKEN] node examples/example-headless.js
```
</CodeGroup>

## What's next?

Great, you're now set up with an API client and have made your first request to the API. Here are a few links that might be handy as you venture further into the GoLogin API:
